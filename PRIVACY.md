# Privacy Policy

DarkMinPDF does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, browsing history, or usage information. All PDF rendering and theme preferences are processed locally on your device. No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind is implemented.

This extension requires broad host permissions solely to intercept PDF requests and redirect them to the local viewer. No data leaves your browser.

If this policy changes in the future, users will be notified via an extension update with revised documentation.
