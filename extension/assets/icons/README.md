# Icons

Placeholder icons are provided. For production use, create proper icons:

- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

You can use a service like https://www.canva.com or https://www.figma.com to design icons.

The icon should represent a PDF document, ideally with a document shape and "PDF" text or a book/document icon.
